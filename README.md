# OtousanLiveWallPaper
Live wallpaper for Android based on the Loveable Softbank Mascot "Otousan"

An Android Live Wallpaper I created to learn some Android programming.

I downloaded some pictures of Softbank's mascot at the time "Otousan" (A white dog) from the internet and created this wallpaper (Softbank is a mobile phone operator in Japan).

Otousan sits there, and will look in different directions on the screen tracking where you scroll with your finger. If you tap on him he will mutter one of several quotes in Japanese.

The wallpaper was originally written for the HTC Desire and so the pictures are probably not the right size for modern screen sizes.

Note that the pictures and sound files are probably copywrited material, I will remove them if requested.
